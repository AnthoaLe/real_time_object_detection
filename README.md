# real_time_object_detection

Real time object detection utilizing TensorFlow for Flutter in order to recognize and identify objects.
Built within Android Studio for Android mobile devices.

## Getting Started

This project requires an Android device with access to the camera in order to function.A
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

When running, from the home screen, simply tap on the Real Time Detection button and allow
camera permissions.

Due to the limitation of running the TensorFlow Lite model, the application has limited access
therefore only being able to identify common objects with limited specificity.
